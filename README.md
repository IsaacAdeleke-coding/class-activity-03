# Dice Rolling Simulation - Class Activity 03

## Overview

This program simulates the rolling of two dice. It uses random number generation to produce two values between 1 and 6, representing the outcome of each die. The program leverages C++'s standard library functions `rand()` and `srand()` along with `time()` to ensure the randomness of each dice roll.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: The program generates random values between 1 and 6 for each die.
- **Seeded Randomness**: The random number generator is seeded with the current time, ensuring that each execution produces different outcomes.
- **Output**: The values for both dice are displayed on the console.

## How It Works

1. **Seeding the Random Number Generator**:
   - The function `srand(time(0) & 0xFFFFFFFF)` is used to seed the random number generator with the current time. This ensures that the numbers generated by `rand()` are different on each run.
   
2. **Rolling the Dice**:
   - The dice are rolled by generating two random numbers in the range [1, 6]. This is achieved by using the formula:
     ```
     (rand() % (maxValue - minValue + 1)) + minValue
     ```
     where `minValue` is 1 and `maxValue` is 6, ensuring the results are within the expected range for a die.

3. **Displaying the Results**:
   - The program outputs the results of both dice to the console in a simple format.
